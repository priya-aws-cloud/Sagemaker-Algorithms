sagemaker built-in algorithms that can be used for training and deploying machine learning models.
Amazon SageMaker is a fully managed machine learning service offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It provides a variety of built-in algorithms that can be used for training and deploying machine learning models. These algorithms cover a wide range of applications and are optimized to work efficiently with large datasets. Here are some popular SageMaker algorithms:

1. Linear Learner: This algorithm is used for linear regression and binary/multiclass classification tasks. It can handle both sparse and dense input data.

2. XGBoost: XGBoost is a gradient boosting algorithm known for its high performance and scalability. It is used for classification and regression tasks and supports various objective functions.

3. Random Cut Forest (RCF): RCF is an unsupervised algorithm used for anomaly detection. It is particularly useful for detecting anomalies in large-scale, high-dimensional data.

4. K-means: K-means is a clustering algorithm used for partitioning data into K clusters. It is widely used for customer segmentation, image compression, and document clustering.

5. Principal Component Analysis (PCA): PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique used to identify the most important features in a dataset. It is useful for visualization, noise filtering, and feature extraction.

6. DeepAR: DeepAR is a recurrent neural network (RNN) algorithm used for time series forecasting. It can handle multivariate time series data and capture complex patterns.

7. Object2Vec: Object2Vec is a deep learning algorithm used for generating embeddings from unstructured data. It can be used for tasks like document similarity, recommender systems, and text classification.

8. BlazingText: BlazingText is an algorithm for text classification and word2vec embeddings. It is based on fastText and supports supervised and unsupervised learning.

These are just a few examples of the algorithms available in Amazon SageMaker. SageMaker also provides support for custom algorithms and frameworks, allowing you to bring your own algorithms and train models using your preferred tools.
